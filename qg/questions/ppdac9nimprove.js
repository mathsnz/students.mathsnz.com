I am going to use the students in our class to try and work this out.  Plan We are going to record the height of students in my class by getting them to take their shoes off, get them to stand against a wall with a tape measure on it and have someone else put a book on their head and record their height in centimetres.  Data Boys Heights (cm): 165, 170, 156, 169, 166, 163, 170, 167, 165, 180, 168, 173, 164, 180 Girls Heights (cm): 159, 163, 163, 173, 155, 167, 168, 156, 160, 163, 160, 157, 158, 159, 147, 168  Analysis    I notice the males’ median height is 167.5cm whereas the females’ median height is only 160cm. This means the males median height is 7.5cm bigger than the females median height.  I notice the females’ heights are more spread out than the males’ heights. I know this because box is much wider for the females than for the males. This means the middle 50% is more spread out for the females than for the males.  I notice there is one female that is much shorter than the other females. I can see this as there is one point further to the left than the others. Looking at the data, she is only 12 years old, so it may be because she hasn’t grown as much yet.  Conclusion Overall I can say Year 9 males tend to be taller than Year 9 females as the boxes do not overlap. ';var description="Drag and drop to put the words into the correct place:"
