We are going to record the arm span of students in my class by standing facing a whiteboard and raising both arms until they are stretched out as far as we can, one of them touching the left of the board and getting a partner to read off how far I am reaching on the measuring tape.  I will record this data in a table.  Analysis    I notice there was one student who did not record their arm span. As a result, we only have 29 points on our graph, not 30.  From my graph, I can see there is a positive trend. I know this because the points seem get higher as they go further right and the ellipse slopes upwards. Therefore, I can say as height increases, so does the arm span.  We can also see that the trend is also reasonably strong. I know this because the ellipse is quite skinny.  I can also see there is one student who has a much longer arm span than the others. They have a height of 180cm and an arm span of 200cm. This may be because they didn’t measure it properly.  Conclusion This means if a student in our class is tall I would expect them to have a big arm span, and if they are short I would expect them to have a small arm span.
