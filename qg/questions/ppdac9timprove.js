Plan We will collect data for each day, over the first 4 weeks of Term 2. We will record how many Year 9 students were at school each day. Analysis Overall Trend Overall there appears to be a slight decrease in the number of students attending. I can see this as the highest points in week 2, 3 and 4 keep dropping, as do the lowest points. The highest point in Week 2 is 342 whereas the highest point in Week 4 is only 320. The lowest point in Week 2 is 279, and the lowest point in Week 4 is 269. This means as the term goes on less Year 9 students are attending school. Seasonality I can see that the highest attendance each week is always on a Tuesday. I know this because the second point in each week is always the furthest up the graph. Tuesdays are normally about 30 students higher than any other day in the week. This means more students are at school on a Tuesday than any other day. I notice that the lowest attendance each week is always on a Friday. I know this as the last point in each week is always the lowest down on the graph. Fridays are normally about 30 students lower than any other day in the week. This means less students are at school on a Friday than any other day. I think this might be because people are more tired by the end of the week so more likely to be sick, and more likely to go away on a holiday. Conclusion Yes, there is a pattern to the attendance of Year 9 students. Tuesdays is always high and Fridays is always low, and overall there is a slow drop in the number of Year 9 students attending.';var description="Drag and drop to put the words into the correct place:"
